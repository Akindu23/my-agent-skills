# Break signatures

What a break looks like on screen, its usual cause, and the fix. Write each fix with the project's own utilities and design tokens; the CSS here names the property, not the final code.

## Signatures

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Avatar or icon squished into an oval or pill | Flex child shrinking | `flex-shrink: 0` on the avatar, icon, and any fixed-size box |
| Text overflows its box instead of wrapping or truncating | Flex/grid child has `min-width: auto` | `min-width: 0` on the text column (`minmax(0, 1fr)` in grid) |
| Email or URL runs past the edge | No break opportunities in the string | `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on that element |
| Trailing action (••• menu, button) pushed off-screen or clipped | Middle content took all the space | `min-width: 0` on the middle, `flex-shrink: 0` on the action |
| Badge wraps onto two lines | Badge allowed to shrink | `white-space: nowrap; flex-shrink: 0` on the badge, and decide what yields instead |
| Avatar centered against a three-line name looks adrift | `align-items: center` on rows of varying height | Top-align (`align-items: flex-start`) once text can wrap |
| Last row cut off at a hard edge mid-glyph | Fixed-height container with no fade or scroll affordance | Visible scrollbar or a fade mask, and ensure `overflow` is intended |
| Long word breaks mid-word in a heading | `word-break: break-all` | `overflow-wrap: anywhere` breaks only when it has to |
| Wrong initials (`"J"` for "Jo", `"CI"` for "… Montgomery III", `"�"` for an emoji-first name) | `.split(' ')[0][0]` style code | Initials from grapheme clusters (`Intl.Segmenter`), first + last word, fallback icon |
| Orphaned `—` or empty line where the role was | Placeholder rendered for a missing optional field | Omit the line, or reserve its height intentionally |
| "1 members", "0 member" | Hardcoded plural | `Intl.PluralRules`, or separate strings per count |
| Numbers jitter when they update, columns misalign | Proportional figures | `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` |
| `1284`, `1,284.000000001`, `NaN`, `undefined` | Raw number rendered | `Intl.NumberFormat` with the user's locale; guard null |
| Long translated button label overflows | Fixed-width button | Width from content with `min-width`, never a fixed `width` |
| Diacritics or tall scripts (Vietnamese, Thai) clipped top or bottom | Tight `line-height` with `overflow: hidden` | Looser `line-height` or no clipping on text boxes |
| Broken-image icon in the avatar | No `onError` fallback | Fall back to initials; `object-fit: cover` for any aspect ratio |
| Truncated text with no way to read it | `text-overflow: ellipsis` and nothing else | `title` attribute or a tooltip, and the full value elsewhere (detail view) |
| Scrolling 1,000 rows stutters | Every row rendered | Virtualize, or paginate, and say which |
| Content renders raw `<b>`, `&amp;`, or `**text**` | Wrong escaping layer | Escape once, at render; never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` user data |

## Truncate, wrap, or clamp

Every long string forces this choice. Make it per field:

- **Wrap** text the user needs in full to identify something: names, titles in a detail view. Two lines is usually fine; four is a sign the column is too narrow.
- **Truncate at the end** for secondary metadata where the start carries the meaning: role, description, last message preview. Always pair with a way to see the full value.
- **Truncate in the middle** when items differ at the *end*: file names (`Q3-report…v12-final.pdf`), emails sharing a long domain, paths, hashes. End-truncation makes them identical.
- **Clamp** (`line-clamp: 2`) for multi-line previews in cards, so card heights stay predictable.
- **Never truncate** numbers, amounts, dates, or anything the user compares. Give them the room.
