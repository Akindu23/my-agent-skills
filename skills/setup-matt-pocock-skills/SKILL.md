description: Sets up an `## Agent skills` block in AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md and `docs/agents/` so the engineering skills know this repo's issue tracker (local markdown under `work/` by default; GitHub and GitLab also supported), triage label vocabulary, and domain doc layout. Run before first use of `to-tickets`, `to-spec`, `to-plan`, `triage`, `wayfinder`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `tdd`, `implement`, or `improve-codebase-architecture` — or if those skills appear to be missing context about the issue tracker, triage labels, or domain docs.

# Setup Matt Pocock's Skills

Scaffold the per-repo configuration that the engineering skills assume:

- **Issue tracker** — where issues live (local markdown under `work/` by default; GitHub and GitLab are also supported out of the box)
- **Triage labels** — the strings used for the five canonical triage roles
- **Domain docs** — where `CONTEXT.md` and ADRs live, and the consumer rules for reading them

This is a prompt-driven skill, not a deterministic script. Explore, present what you found, confirm with the user, then write.

## Process

### 1. Explore

Look at the current repo to understand its starting state. Read whatever exists; don't assume:

- `git remote -v` and `.git/config` — is this a GitHub or GitLab repo? Which one?
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — does either exist? Is there already an `## Agent skills` section in either?
- `CONTEXT.md` and `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root
- `docs/adr/` and any `src/*/docs/adr/` directories
- `docs/agents/` — does this skill's prior output already exist?
- `work/` — sign that the local-markdown issue tracker convention is already in use
- `.scratch/` — legacy local-tracker root; if present and `work/` is missing (or both exist), plan a migrate into `work/` when local markdown is chosen
- Is the `triage` skill installed? (a `triage` skill folder alongside this one, or `triage` in your available skills.) This decides whether Section B runs at all.
- Monorepo signals — a `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, a `workspaces` field in `package.json`, or a populated `packages/*` with its own `src/`. Present only in a genuinely large multi-package repo; their absence means single-context, which is almost every repo.

### 2. Present findings and ask

Summarise what's present and what's missing. Then take the sections in order — one section, one answer, then the next.

## User clarifications (Cursor)

When you need a **discrete decision** with a small set of clear options (about 2–6), prefer the **`AskQuestion`** tool so the user gets structured choices. Ask **one decision at a time** when this skill already sequences questions that way.

If **`AskQuestion`** is unavailable in the current environment, ask the same choices in ordinary chat (same options, same ordering).

Use **plain chat** (not forced multiple-choice) when the answer is inherently free-form—for example pasted logs, a paragraph describing a custom tracker workflow, or an open-ended design explanation.

Lead each section with the recommended answer so the user can accept it in a word. Give a one-line explainer only when the choice genuinely branches; skip the section entirely when exploration already settled it (Section B when `triage` isn't installed, Section C when there's no monorepo).

Assume the user does not know what these terms mean. Each section that *does* run starts with a short explainer (what it is, why these skills need it, what changes if they pick differently). Then show the choices and the default.

**Section A — Issue tracker.**

> Explainer: The "issue tracker" is where issues live for this repo. Skills like `to-tickets`, `triage`, `to-spec`, and `wayfinder` read from and write to it — they need to know whether to write markdown under `work/`, call `gh issue create`, call `glab issue create`, or follow some other workflow you describe. Pick the place you actually track work for this repo.

Default posture: **local markdown under `work/`** (committed, not gitignored). Lead with that as the recommended answer even when a GitHub or GitLab remote exists — don't auto-pick a remote tracker just because `origin` points at github.com or gitlab.com. Still list matching remotes as alternatives so one word can accept local, or the user can opt into Issues.

Offer:

- **Local markdown** (recommended) — issues live as files under `work/<feature-slug>/` in this repo
- **GitHub** — issues live in the repo's GitHub Issues (uses the `gh` CLI); list when a GitHub remote exists, or if the user asks
- **GitLab** — issues live in the repo's GitLab Issues (uses the [`glab`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli) CLI); list when a GitLab remote exists (`gitlab.com` or self-hosted), or if the user asks
- **Other** (Jira, Linear, etc.) — ask the user to describe the workflow in one paragraph; the skill will record it as freeform prose

If exploration found `.scratch/` and the user chooses local markdown, **migrate**: move contents into `work/` (same `<feature-slug>/` layout), then write the new convention. Don't leave both roots in active use.

Record the choice in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`. The GitHub and GitLab templates carry a "PRs as a request surface" flag, defaulted **off** — leave it off and don't raise it; a user who wants external PRs in the triage queue can flip the flag in the file later.

**Section B — Triage label vocabulary.** Skip this section entirely if the `triage` skill isn't installed (exploration told you) — an uninstalled skill needs no labels.

If it is installed, ask exactly one question:

> Do you want to keep the default triage labels? (recommended: **yes**)

The defaults are the five canonical roles, each label string equal to its name: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. On **yes**, write them as-is. Only if the user says no — usually because their tracker already uses other names (e.g. `bug:triage` for `needs-triage`) — collect the overrides so `triage` applies existing labels instead of creating duplicates.

**Section C — Domain docs.** Default to **single-context** — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root. This fits almost every repo; write it without asking.

Offer **multi-context** — a root `CONTEXT-MAP.md` pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files — only when exploration found monorepo signals. Then confirm which layout they want.

> Explainer (only when offering multi-context): Some skills (`improve-codebase-architecture`, `diagnosing-bugs`, `tdd`) read a `CONTEXT.md` file to learn the project's domain language, and `docs/adr/` for past architectural decisions. They need to know whether the repo has one global context or multiple (e.g. a monorepo with separate frontend/backend contexts) so they look in the right place.

### 3. Confirm and edit

Show the user a draft of:

- The `## Agent skills` block to add to whichever of `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is being edited (see step 4 for selection rules)
- The contents of `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/domain.md`, and `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` (the last only when `triage` is installed)

Let them edit before writing.

### 4. Write

**Pick the file to edit:**

- If `CLAUDE.md` exists, edit it.
- Else if `AGENTS.md` exists, edit it.
- If neither exists, ask the user which one to create — don't pick for them.

Never create `AGENTS.md` when `CLAUDE.md` already exists (or vice versa) — always edit the one that's already there.

If an `## Agent skills` block already exists in the chosen file, update its contents in-place rather than appending a duplicate. Don't overwrite user edits to the surrounding sections.

The block:

```markdown
## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

[one-line summary of where issues are tracked]. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

[one-line summary of the label vocabulary]. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

[one-line summary of layout — "single-context" or "multi-context"]. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
```

Include the `### Triage labels` sub-block, and write `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`, only when `triage` is installed and Section B ran. When it isn't, both are omitted.

Then write the docs files using the seed templates in this skill folder as a starting point:

- [issue-tracker-local.md](./issue-tracker-local.md) — local-markdown issue tracker (`work/`)
- [issue-tracker-github.md](./issue-tracker-github.md) — GitHub issue tracker
- [issue-tracker-gitlab.md](./issue-tracker-gitlab.md) — GitLab issue tracker
- [triage-labels.md](./triage-labels.md) — label mapping (only if `triage` is installed)
- [domain.md](./domain.md) — domain doc consumer rules + layout

When writing the local tracker and `.scratch/` still has content, perform the migrate into `work/` as part of this step (after the user confirmed Section A), then remove or leave an empty `.scratch/` only if nothing remains.

For "other" issue trackers, write `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` from scratch using the user's description.

### 5. Done

Tell the user the setup is complete and which engineering skills will now read from these files. Mention they can edit `docs/agents/*.md` directly later — re-running this skill is only necessary if they want to switch issue trackers or restart from scratch.
